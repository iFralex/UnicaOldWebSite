# Unica - Old Website

## Overview
Unica, a jewellery brand founded in early 2023, is a brand that places immense significance on the meaning behind each piece of jewellery. Unica offers a wide range of unique and meaningful jewellery, from earrings featuring the symbol of 'E' upside down with an exclamation point, representing the uniqueness of each individual in mathematical language, to geometrically inspired pieces like the stellated dodecahedron, symbolizing the idea that success can always be restarted from scratch. The brand also offers DNA-shaped bracelets with various charms, symbolizing life and the unique symbols that define it.

## Website
The Unica website, although no longer in use due to outdated information, was meticulously crafted by myself, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Firebase Database for data storage. The website is filled with carefully designed animations and unique features, divided into distinct sections.
